## Affiliations
I am  an associate professor  at  Université Côte d'Azur,  affiliated jointly  
- with the [out-of-equilibrium and non-linear physics team](https://inphyni.univ-cotedazur.eu/research/nonlinear-physics-complex-fluids-and-biophysics){:target="_blank"} at  [Institut de Physique de Nice](https://inphyni.univ-cotedazur.eu/){:target="_blank"}  for research
- and with the  [Polytech Nice Sophia engineering school](https://polytech.univ-cotedazur.fr/) for  teaching.


## Research

My research activities address the stochastic modeling of turbulent patterns, combining insights from observations, direct numerical simulations and  solvable  minimal models. In the past  years, I have been working  on problems involving  an interplay between singularities  and predictability, more specifically focusing on

- the statistical modeling of intermittency, 

- blowup scenarios in fluid models, 

- the spontaneous stochasticity phenomenon.  

*Those topics offer many exciting projects for prospective Master/PhD students and postdocs. Any inquiry, please  feel free to contact me.*
